## Solidity -- Ethereum's Programming Language

[Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is Ethereum's own blockchain programming language to create smart contracts (aka Ethereum decentralized applications or dapps in short).

> Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language whose syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and it is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

> Solidity is statically typed, supports inheritance, libraries and complex user-defined types.

Solidity Browser is a nice, simple web IDE, which makes it much easier to get started and realize new smart contracts.

Solidity is a Turing-complete programming language.

Much of Solidity is intuitive for anyone familiar with JavaScript, Java, or C languages.

Smart contracts are written in the Solidity language and executed on the Ethereum network.

### BTC Relay Ethereum DApp

[BTC Relay Ethereum DApp](http://btcrelay.org/) is a bridge between the Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum smart contracts. It is an Ethereum smart contract that stores Bitcoin block headers.

What's nice about BTC Relay DApp is that it is [open source](https://github.com/ethereum/btcrelay) and you can use it to learn how to write your own smart contracts.
