## Ethereum Blockchain

* Ethereum's [White Paper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper)
* Ethereum is a blockchain where Dapps, tokens or coins can be built upon.
    * ETH blockchain
* Dapps (Decentralized Applications)
* **ether** - the token that powers the ethereum blockchain
* alternative asset protocol (to Bitcoin)
* On Ethereum, you develop a so-called Dapp (decentralized app), which consists of two parts: a frontend (written in HTML as web app or any other client using a supported programming language), and a backend (think of it as the ‘database’ for your frontend). A frontend can be a full blockchain peer communicating directly with the backend. The huge benefit here is that every client is a full member of the trusted blockchain network. This is the ideal blockchain world.
1. [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/) - a specific blockchain language to define smart contracts. Solidity Browser is a nice, simple web IDE, which makes it much easier to get started and realize new smart contracts.
    * much of Solidity is intuitive for anyone familiar with JavaScript, Java, or C languages.
1. **Ether** is needed to "pay" for blockchain transactions
1. Ethereum is...
    * http://eth.guide/
    * a single public blockchain, and a protocol for the creation of many blockchains
    * similar to Bitcoin (and often dubbed as _Bitcoin of DAP platforms_)
    * supports its own digital currency, **ether** (like bitcoin)
    * supports **smart contracts**
        * agreements / financial contracts written in computer code that execute automatically when certain conditions are met.
        * some business logic that runs on the network, semi-autonomously moving value and enforcing payment agreements between parties
        * code in the Solidity language to be executed on the Ethereum network
    * a Turing-complete blockchain = a data structure + **Solidity** built-in programming language
    * **Solidity** is a Turing-complete programming language
    * The term "Ethereum" can refer to: the **Ethereum protocol**, the **Ethereum network** created by computers using the protocol, and the **Ethereum project** funding development of the aforementioned two.
    * open source blockchain network
    * building economic systems in pure software
    * The Ethereum network functions as one large computer which executes programs in lockstep; it is a machine which is "virtualized" by a network of other machines. Being composed of many private computers, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) itself can be said to be a shared computer which is ownerless.
    * Changes to the EVM are achieved through hard forking: persuading the entire community of node operators to upgrade to a new version of the Ethereum software.
    * building economic systems in pure software
1. All transactions in Ethereum are stored on the blockchain, a canonical history of state changes stored on every single Ethereum node.
    * When you pay for computing time on the Ethereum network, this includes the cost of running the transaction and for storage of the data included in your smart contract.
    * Because the Ethereum network requires all nodes to keep a full state database of all contracts, any node can query the database locally.

    * a wallet = holds your ether

    * With Mist and the Ethereum command-line tools, sample contracts can be tested with fake ether to ensure that you don’t lose any real money while debugging.
