# Soft and Hard Forks

A **fork** is a new version of protocol or software with new features. A fork is like a software upgrade that may or may not be compatible with the old versions. A fork is therefore a continuation of the older version of a protocol with new features.

A **soft fork (SF)** is when a protocol changes make the new protocol compatible with the old and there are only software changes (e.g. bug fixes).

A **hard fork (HF)** is when a protocol changes that leads to creating a new software to handle it, but the changes create new transactions on the new blockchain ledger that are incompatible with the transactions on the blockchain before and so they in turn create their own separate blockchain.

A hard-fork is a change to the protocol that makes upgraded nodes incompatible with nodes running the older version of the software, and vice versa.

After a hard fork there are two separate blockchain networks (as if the blockchains started without a common ancestor or the only commonality between different blockchains are the transactions before the hard fork).

As with any blockchain network the number of miners to "dig the tokens" makes a network sound, reliable and working. Every hard fork makes the size of a network smaller (at least at the very beginning). If widely supported, the new network will eventually grow bigger than its ancestors, but could also get abandoned and ultimately disappear.

Examples of hard forks on the Bitcoin blockchain:

1. [Bitcoin Cash (BCC)](./bcc.md)
1. [Bitcoin Gold (BTG)](./btg.md)

## How to Access New Token After Hard Fork

Quoting [Can you elaborate on how bitcoin holders will receive bitcoin gold after the October 25th hard fork?](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-elaborate-on-how-bitcoin-holders-will-receive-bitcoin-gold-after-the-October-25th-hard-fork).

> All hard forks operate (effectively) the same way. Youâ€™ll want to export your private key from your current Bitcoin wallet, and then download a wallet that supports the new blockchain (in this case, Bitcoin Gold).

> When a blockchain splits the amount of coins you receive will match the amount you owned from the previous blockchain.

> If your wallet supports Bitcoin Gold (BTG) it will show up automatically, if your wallet does not support Bitcoin Gold you will need to import your wallets private key into a Bitcoin Gold supported wallet to access your BTG.
