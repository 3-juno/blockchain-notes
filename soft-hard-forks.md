# Soft and Hard Forks

A **fork** is to create a new version of protocol or software with new features

A *soft fork (SF)* is when a protocol changes make the new protocol compatible with the old and there are only software changes (e.g. bug fixes).

A *hard fork (HF)* is when a protocol changes that leads to creating new software to handle it. The changes create new transactions on the new blockchain that are incompatible with the old ones and so they in turn create their own separate blockchain.

> All hard forks operate (effectively) the same way. Youâ€™ll want to export your private key from your current Bitcoin wallet, and then download a wallet that supports the new blockchain (in this case, Bitcoin Gold).

> When a blockchain splits the amount of coins you receive will match the amount you owned from the previous blockchain.

> If your wallet supports Bitcoin Gold (BTG) it will show up automatically, if your wallet does not support Bitcoin Gold you will need to import your wallets private key into a Bitcoin Gold supported wallet to access your BTG.
