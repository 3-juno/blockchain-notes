# Bitcoin Cash (BCC) Hard Fork

The home page of Bitcoin Cash is https://www.bitcoincash.org

The ticker symbol is **BCC/BCH** (the most popular tickers), but **XBC** is used to meet the International Standard for currency codes (ISO 4217).

Quoting [Bitcoin Cash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/#about) (with some changes):

> All Bitcoin holders as of block 478558 (August 1st, 2017 about 13:16 UTC) are also owners of Bitcoin Cash and have the same amount of Bitcoin Cash as they had Bitcoin at that time.

Quoting Bitcoin Cash's [New Features](https://www.bitcoincash.org/#features) (with some changes):

1. The **blocksize limit** has been made adjustable, with an increased default of **8MB**
    * the legacy Bitcoin code had a maximum limit of 1MB of data per block (or about 3 transactions per second) that caused issues with the old Bitcoin network's capacity as the time required to confirm transactions grew too much).
1. A new SigHash transaction signature hashing algorithm indicated by the flag SIGHASH_FORKID (that provides replay protection not valid on the old Bitcoin Legacy network).

FIXME: What's SigHash?
