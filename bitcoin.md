From [Why I’m short Ethereum (and long Bitcoin)](https://medium.com/@tuurdemeester/why-im-short-ethereum-and-long-bitcoin-aee5b1c198fd):

> The Bitcoin ‘digital cash’ core protocol is a stern and barren environment. Its primary client is called Bitcoin Core, which runs on the C++ programming language. C++ is known for its precision in allocating memory and high speed, and for its steep learning curve. For constructing new transaction-commands, Bitcoin uses a scripting system: there’s a list of less than 70 precise commands that can be executed at the core protocol level. Bitcoin smart contracts have been part of the roadmap since Satoshi, and a lot of thinking has gone into the limitations required to maintain consistency with the security confines of the Nakamoto framework.
