# Segregated Witness (SegWit)

[Segregated Witness (SegWit)](https://segwit.org/) increases the capacity of the blockchain, thereby allowing faster processing of payments, called lightning fast payments

  * Interestingly, while a signature on a physical check takes up maybe 10% of the check, a digital signature in bitcoin takes up more like 50% of the digital check.
  * The first would be to make the box sizes bigger. The second would be to create a new type of check and only give bigger boxes to those who request them.
  * Bitcoin Cash is essentially using this solution by lifting the 1MB block size limit and implementing an 8MB block size instead.
  * SegWit cuts the checks in half and sends everything but the signature to everyone that’s accepting the old, smaller box. We send the larger boxes to everyone that’s accepting the new, larger box.

  * the digital signature needs to be segregated from the transactions data
