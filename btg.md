# Bitcoin Gold (BTG) Hard Fork

The home page of Bitcoin Gold is http://btcgpu.org.

As a hard fork Bitcoin Gold aims at releasing an improved Bitcoin protocol.

Quoting Coindesk's [First Cash, Now Gold? Another Bitcoin Hard Fork Is on the Way](https://www.coindesk.com/first-cash-now-gold-another-bitcoin-hard-fork-way/):

> Bitcoin Gold wants to create a truly decentralized bitcoin by opening up mining to more participants by replacing bitcoin's mining algorithm with one that will enable it to be mined with graphics cards.

> Bitcoin gold will implement a proof-of-work change from bitcoin's SHA256 to Equihash, a memory-hard algorithm that is ASIC-resistant and optimized for GPU mining.

> GPU mining can't prevent centralization. GPU [markets] are controlled by Nvidia and AMD

> every bitcoin user at the time will have an equal amount of bitcoin gold associated with their private key.

> It is a minimalist fork of the Bitcoin Core codebase in the spirit of litecoin â€“ only a few conservative modifications
